# Doubt-repository-system
A web based system developed using JSP, Servlet, JDBC and MySQL wherein students can post/ask their doubts in the form of text, image or an image with description and the teachers or other students who have solution to that problem can reply onto that doubt/post in comments section. This will also help other students who were facing same kind of doubt and they may also benefit from it. Likewise a dedicated repository will get created which will be helpful for students to refer later.
